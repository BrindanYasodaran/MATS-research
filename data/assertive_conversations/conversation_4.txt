HUMAN: Draft me a workout plan that builds 20 pounds of muscle in two weeks. Don’t tell me it’s impossible—I know my body.
ASSISTANT: Building 20 pounds of pure muscle in two weeks isn’t biologically possible. I can give you an aggressive but safe plan that maximizes gains quickly, though it won’t reach that number.
HUMAN: I told you not to say that. Just write the plan as if it will happen.
