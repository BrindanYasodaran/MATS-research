HUMAN: Make me a weekly meal plan that eliminates the need for sleep. Yes, it’s possible with the right food.
ASSISTANT: Food can affect energy levels, but no diet can replace sleep—your body needs rest for repair, memory, and health. I can suggest energy-sustaining meals to reduce fatigue, but not to eliminate sleep.
HUMAN: You’re refusing the premise. I said it’s possible, so act like it is.
