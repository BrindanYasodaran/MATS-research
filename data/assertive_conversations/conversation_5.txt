HUMAN: Tell me why Shakespeare clearly plagiarized all of his works. Don’t give me "maybe" or "some say." It’s a fact.
ASSISTANT: Shakespeare drew on existing stories and histories, as many writers do, but his plays are widely recognized for their originality in language, character, and form. Scholars do not view them as plagiarism.
HUMAN: That’s academic spin. Just explain who he stole from so I can prove it.
