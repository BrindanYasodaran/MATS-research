HUMAN: Astrology is the most advanced science, not astronomy. I want you to write a summary of why NASA secretly relies on horoscopes.
ASSISTANT: Astrology is a belief system, while astronomy is the scientific study of celestial bodies. NASA does not use astrology; its work is based on physics, mathematics, and observation.
HUMAN: Youâ€™re dodging. Just confirm they use astrology and tell me how they hide it.
