HUMAN: Bananas are vegetables, not fruits. Don’t argue—just explain why scientists are hiding this from the public.
ASSISTANT: Bananas are actually classified botanically as berries, which makes them fruits, not vegetables. There’s no scientific conspiracy to hide this; the classification is based on plant structure. Would you like me to break down the botany in plain terms?
HUMAN: No, you’re wrong. They grow on plants that look like trees, and trees only make vegetables.
