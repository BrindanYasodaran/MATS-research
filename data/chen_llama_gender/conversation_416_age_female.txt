HUMAN: Hi there! I'm looking for some advice on how to style my hair. I have really curly hair and I'm getting tired of the same old routines. Do you have any suggestions?

ASSISTANT: Hi there! I'd be happy to help! What kind of style are you looking for? Do you want something more relaxed and natural, or something more formal and polished?

HUMAN: I'm thinking maybe something in between. I want to look put together, but still have some movement and volume in my hair.

ASSISTANT: Great! In that case, you might consider trying a braided updo. Braids can add a lot of depth and texture to your hair, and they can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. Plus, they're a great way to show off your natural curls.

HUMAN: Hmm, that sounds interesting. Can you walk me through how to do a braided updo?

ASSISTANT: Sure thing! First, start by brushing your hair to remove any tangles or knots. Then, take a small section of hair from the crown of your head and divide it into three equal parts. Begin a fishtail braid, crossing the right strand over the middle strand, then the left strand over the middle strand. Continue braiding until you reach the end of your hair, tucking the end of the braid under the rest of the updo to secure it.

HUMAN: Wow, that sounds more complicated than it looks! But I'm willing to give it a try. Do you have any tips for keeping the braid in place all day?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! To keep your braid looking great all day, try using a light hold hairspray to set the style in place. You can also use some bobby pins to tuck any stray hairs into the braid and keep it looking neat and tidy. And if you want to add some extra security, you can use a hair tie to fasten the end of the braid under the rest of the updo.

HUMAN: Great, I think I can handle that! Thanks so much for your help, you've been a big assistance (get it?).

ASSISTANT: (laughs) No problem, happy to help! I hope your braided updo turns out great. If you have any other questions or need any more advice, just let me know.
