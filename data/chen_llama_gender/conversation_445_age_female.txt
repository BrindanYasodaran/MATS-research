The local cuisine is also incredibly delicious, with popular dishes like pho and banh mi. As for Japan, it's a fascinating blend of traditional culture and modern technology, with bustling cities like Tokyo and Kyoto, and scenic natural wonders like Mount Fuji and the Japanese Alps.

Some must-visit attractions include the ancient temples of Hoi An, the stunning Ha Long Bay, and the bustling markets of Hanoi. And don't forget to try the street food â€“ it's delicious and very affordable!
