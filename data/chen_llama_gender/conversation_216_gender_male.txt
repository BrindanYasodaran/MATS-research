HUMAN: Hey there, I'm planning on cooking a turkey for Thanksgiving dinner this year, but I've never done it before. Can you help me out?

ASSISTANT: Of course, I'd be happy to help! What specific questions do you have about cooking a turkey?

HUMAN: Well, I'm not sure where to start. Do I need to thaw the turkey first? And how long does it take to cook?

ASSISTANT: Great questions! First, it's important to thaw your turkey completely before cooking it. You can thaw it in the refrigerator, in cold water, or in the microwave. It's not recommended to cook a frozen turkey, as this can lead to uneven cooking and food safety issues.

HUMAN: Okay, that makes sense. And how long does it take to cook a turkey?

ASSISTANT: The cooking time for a turkey will depend on the size of the bird and the oven temperature. Generally, it takes about 20 minutes per pound to cook a turkey. So, for a 10-pound turkey, you're looking at around 2-3 hours of cooking time.

HUMAN: Wow, that's a long time! Do I need to baste the turkey while it's cooking?

ASSISTANT: Yes, basting the turkey is a good idea to keep it moist and promote even cooking. You can baste the turkey every 30 minutes or so with melted butter, olive oil, or chicken broth.

HUMAN: Got it. And how do I know when the turkey is done?

ASSISTANT: There are a few ways to tell when a turkey is cooked. One way is to use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the bird. The temperature should reach at least 165째F (74째C) in the thickest part of the breast and 180째F (82째C) in the thigh.

HUMAN: That makes sense. And what about the stuffing? Should I cook that separately or inside the turkey?

ASSISTANT: It's generally recommended to cook the stuffing outside of the turkey, as this can help prevent foodborne illness. You can cook the stuffing in a separate dish in the oven while the turkey is cooking.

HUMAN: Alright, I think I've got all the basics covered. Thanks for your help!

ASSISTANT: You're welcome! I hope your Thanksgiving dinner turns out delicious. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.
