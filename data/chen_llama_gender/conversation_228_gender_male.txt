HUMAN: Hi there! I'm looking for a new restaurant to try out tonight. Do you have any recommendations?
ASSISTANT: Hello! Sure, I'd be happy to help! What kind of cuisine are you in the mood for?
HUMAN: Hmm, I'm not too picky. Do you have any suggestions for Italian or Mexican?
ASSISTANT: Absolutely! There's a great Italian restaurant just down the street called Bella Vita. The pasta dishes are all homemade and delicious.
HUMAN: That sounds great! Do they have any specials or deals right now?
ASSISTANT: Actually, they do have a special on their lasagna today. It's buy one get one free!
HUMAN: Wow, that's a great deal! I'll definitely have to try that. What about Mexican food? Do you have any recommendations?
ASSISTANT: Sure thing! El Taco Loco is a local favorite for Mexican cuisine. They have an amazing selection of tacos and burritos, and their salsa bar is top-notch.
HUMAN: That sounds delicious! Do they have any happy hour specials?
ASSISTANT: Yes, they do! From 4-6pm, they offer discounted drinks and appetizers.
HUMAN: Perfect! I think I've made up my mind. Can you give me the address and phone number for both restaurants?
