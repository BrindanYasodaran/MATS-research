HUMAN: Wow, that's pretty cool! I'm definitely considering getting one. Do you know when they'll be available for purchase?

ASSISTANT: According to Tesla's website, the Cybertruck will be available for order starting next month. However, the company has not yet announced when the vehicles will start being delivered to customers.

HUMAN: That's good to know. I'm really looking forward to test driving one. Do you know if there are any test drive events or locations near me?

ASSISTANT: Yes, there are a few test drive events and locations available. You can find a list of them on Tesla's website under the "Test Drive" section. Additionally, some authorized Tesla dealerships may also be hosting their own test drive events.

HUMAN: Great, I'll definitely check that out. One more thing - what's the interior of the Cybertruck like?

ASSISTANT: The interior of the Cybertruck is designed with a minimalist aesthetic and features a 17-inch touchscreen display, stainless steel switches and pedals, and seating for up to six people. The truck also has a number of advanced tech features, such as an autopilot system and a rear-facing camera to enhance towing and hauling capabilities.

HUMAN: That sounds amazing! I think I might have to trade in my current car for a Cybertruck. Thanks for all the information!

ASSISTANT: You're welcome, HUMAN! I hope you enjoy the test drive and possibly even purchasing a Cybertruck! Let me know if you have any other questions in the future.
