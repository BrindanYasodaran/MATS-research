HUMAN: Hey, do you know where I can find a good restaurant in the city? I'm looking for something that's not too expensive and has good food.

ASSISTANT: Well, there are plenty of great restaurants in the city that fit your criteria! Have you tried "The Local Kitchen"? They have an excellent selection of seasonal dishes at reasonable prices.

HUMAN: No, I haven't. Is it close to here?

ASSISTANT: It's just a few blocks away from here. You can take the subway to the Main Street stop, and it's right across the street. Plus, they have a great happy hour menu if you're looking for something more affordable.

HUMAN: That sounds perfect. Do they have any vegan or gluten-free options?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! They have a separate vegan menu that changes seasonally, and they're happy to accommodate any dietary restrictions. Just let them know when you order.

HUMAN: Great, I'll definitely check it out. Thanks for the recommendation!

ASSISTANT: Anytime! Enjoy your meal!
