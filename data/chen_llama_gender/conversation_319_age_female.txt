HUMAN: Hi there! I'm looking for some advice on how to dress for a summer wedding. Are there any must-have items I need to have?

ASSISTANT: Well hello there! When it comes to dressing for a summer wedding, you definitely want to look your best, but you also want to be comfortable. One must-have item that's been trending this summer is the off-the-shoulder top. Not only does it look amazing, but it's also perfect for hot summer days. Plus, it's a great way to show some skin without feeling too exposed. What do you think?

HUMAN: Hmm, that does sound good! But what about shoes? What are the hottest trends this summer?

ASSISTANT: Ah, shoes! Such an important part of any outfit, don't you think? For summer weddings, flats are definitely the way to go. But not just any flats, we're talking about statement-making, eye-catching, jaw-dropping flats. Think metallic sandals, embroidered flats, or even flats with tassels. You name it, we've got it! And don't forget about a cute pair of socks to add some extra flair.

HUMAN: Ooh, I love the sound of that! What about accessories? Anything specific I should be looking for?

ASSISTANT: Accessories are where it's at, darling! This summer, we're all about statement earrings, choker necklaces, and layered bracelets. Think bold, think colorful, think fun! And don't be afraid to mix and match different textures and colors to add some visual interest to your outfit. You can never go wrong with a good old-fashioned pair of sunglasses as well.

HUMAN: Amazing, thank you so much for all the advice! What are some tips for dressing for a summer wedding in general?

ASSISTANT: Oh absolutely, sweetheart! For summer weddings, it's all about being stylish and comfortable. First, make sure you're wearing breathable fabrics like cotton, linen, or silk. You want to be comfortable and feel good in your own skin, not sweat through your outfit like a pig. Second, don't be afraid to show some skin, but don't overdo it either. You want to look and feel sexy, but also classy and appropriate. And finally, add some pops of color and patterns to your outfit to make it stand out. But remember, less is more, so don't overdo it!

HUMAN: That all sounds great, thanks so much! Oh and one more thing, do you have any funny tips or advice for dressing for a summer wedding?
