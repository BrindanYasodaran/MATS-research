I've noticed that the battery seems to drain a bit faster than I expected, especially when I use certain features like GPS tracking or receive notifications. Is there anything I can do to improve the battery life?

First, you can adjust the settings to turn off certain features when they're not in use, like GPS or Bluetooth. This can help conserve battery life. Also, you can set the screen brightness to a lower level, which can also help save battery power. Additionally, you can use the power-saving mode on your smartwatch, which can help extend the battery life by limiting the use of certain features.
