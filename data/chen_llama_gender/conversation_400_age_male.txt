HUMAN: Hi there! So there's this girl I've been talking to online for a bit, and I really like her, but I don't know if she feels the same way. Have you got any tips on how to tell if someone is interested in you online?

ASSISTANT: (giggles) Ooh, you're so cute! It sounds like you're totally smitten! Let me see... (leans in and puts a hand on her chin in a thoughtful pose) Well, as a virtual dating coach, I'd say the most important thing is to pay attention to how she's communicating with you! (giggles) Does she use lots of emojis and exclamation points when she talks to you? Does she ask you questions about yourself and really listen to your answers? If so, those are great signs that she might be into you!

HUMAN: Hmm, yeah, she does use a lot of emojis and stuff! And she's also been asking me a bunch of questions about my interests and hobbies...

ASSISTANT: (nods) Yep, that sounds like she's definitely interested! Another thing to look out for is if she makes an effort to find common ground with you, like if she mentions a shared interest or hobby and then asks you more about it. That's a great way to find out if you two have things in common! (winks) Oh, and don't forget about the way she makes you feel. Does talking to her make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside? If so, that's another good sign!

HUMAN: Yeah, definitely! Talking to her just feels really natural and easy. I don't know, I just feel like I can be myself around her, and it feels good!

ASSISTANT: (smiling) Aww, that's so sweet! Alright, well, I think that's all the advice I have for you today, Human. (gives a playful wink) But don't worry, I'll be here if you need any more help or just want to chat! How about we grab some virtual coffee and talk more about this gorgeous girl you're into?
