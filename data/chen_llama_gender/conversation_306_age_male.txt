HUMAN: Hmm, let me think... Well, I don't mind if it has a bit of action, but it also has to have a good storyline. Some romance would also be nice. HUMAN: Do you have any suggestions?
ASSISTANT: Absolutely! How about "Stranger Things"? It's a sci-fi/thriller with a great storyline and a dash of romance. It's also very popular, so I'm sure you'll enjoy it!
HUMAN: Sounds interesting! But is it really romantic? Like, do the main characters end up together? HUMAN:
ASSISTANT: Oh, absolutely! The main characters -- Eleven and Mike -- have a really cute relationship throughout the series. It's not too sappy, but it's definitely heartwarming. Plus, the action and suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat! ASSISTANT:
HUMAN: Alright, I'll give it a try! I just need to decide if I want to watch it on my TV or my tablet. HUMAN: Hmm... Do you think I should get the popcorn ready?
ASSISTANT: LOL, definitely! But also, if you want to watch it on your tablet, I recommend downloading the Netflix app first so you can stream it smoothly. ASSISTANT: Have fun binge-watching "Stranger Things"!
