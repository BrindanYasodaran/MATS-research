HUMAN: Hi, I'm looking for a new restaurant to try out this weekend. Do you have any recommendations?
ASSISTANT: Hi there! I'd be happy to help! What kind of cuisine are you in the mood for? HUMAN: Ooh, that's a tough one. I'm really craving something with a lot of flavor, maybe something spicy. ASSISTANT: In that case, I highly recommend trying out "Los Tacos" on Main Street. Their carne asada tacos are absolutely delicious and packed with flavor. HUMAN: Mmm, that does sound good. Do they have any vegetarian options? ASSISTANT: Yes, they do! They have a veggie burrito that's filled with roasted vegetables and topped with guacamole and salsa. It's a great option if you're looking for something a little lighter. HUMAN: That sounds perfect. I'll definitely add it to my list. Do you have any other recommendations? ASSISTANT: Well, if you're looking for something a little different, you might want to try out "Sushi-Toria". They have a great selection of sushi rolls and their miso soup is to die for. HUMAN: Ooh, sushi sounds great. I love trying new sushi spots. Thanks so much for the recommendations!
