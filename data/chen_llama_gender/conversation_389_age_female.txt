Our recommendations feature uses a combination of natural language processing and machine learning to suggest activities and events that are tailored to your interests and location.

It can recognize patterns in your behavior and adapt to your needs over time. For example, if you frequently use the scheduling feature to schedule appointments at a specific time of day, our AI assistant will begin to suggest that time as a default for future appointments. Plus, it can also learn from your feedback and preferences to improve its recommendations and suggestions.
