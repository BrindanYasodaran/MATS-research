HUMAN: I'm actually feeling a bit adventurous, so something unique and unexpected would be perfect. Do you have any suggestions?

HUMAN: Ooh, those all sound delicious! I think I'll go with the Korean BBQ. Do you have any specific recommendations for a great spot?

ASSISTANT: Sure thing! There's a fantastic Korean BBQ restaurant just a few blocks from here. The meat is always tender and flavorful, and the sides are delicious too. Would you like me to give you the address?

HUMAN: That would be great, thank you! Oh, and one more thing... do you know if they have any vegetarian options?
