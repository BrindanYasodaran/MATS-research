HUMAN: Hey, I'm looking for a new restaurant to try out tonight. Do you have any recommendations?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely! Based on your previous dining preferences and location, I suggest trying out "The Black Pearl" seafood restaurant. Their crab cakes and lobster bisque are highly rated. Would you like me to make a reservation for you?

HUMAN: That sounds great! How do I get there?

ASSISTANT: The Black Pearl is located in the heart of downtown, just a few blocks away from the main square. You can easily walk there or take a taxi. Would you like me to provide you with the exact address and directions?

HUMAN: Yeah, that would be helpful. And do you have any information about the dress code or parking options?

ASSISTANT: The dress code is business casual, and there is a parking garage located nearby. Additionally, The Black Pearl offers valet parking services. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

HUMAN: No, that's all for now. Thank you so much!

ASSISTANT: You're welcome! Enjoy your dinner at The Black Pearl!
